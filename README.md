# Plato's Cave

Plato's Cave is a simple platformer game in the style of Celeste and Super Meat Boy made to develop my fundamental Unity programming skills. With three challenging levels filled with hazards such as spikes, hostile slimes and long jumps, you must rush into the exit while collecting as much coins along the way.

This project took me around 10 days to finish.

## Things that I've learned throughout making this project:
- Slicing Sprite Sheets, Layering Unity Tilemap, figuring out how to use Unity Rule Tiles and adding Composite Collider for Tilemaps
