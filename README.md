# Plato's Cave

Plato's Cave is a simple platformer game in the style of Celeste and Super Meat Boy made to develop my fundamental Unity programming skills. With three challenging levels filled with hazards such as spikes, hostile slimes, and long jumps, you must rush into the exit while collecting as much coins along the way. Gravity will serve as your freedom or your tragic end. Only the bravest daredevils would be able to escape the deepest and treacherous cave of Plato!
